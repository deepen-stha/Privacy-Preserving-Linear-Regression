# Privacy Preserving Multiple Linear Regression (Horizontally Partitioned data)
This implements the linear regression where the data is `horizontally partitioned`. Specifically, it enables two parties to jointly perform regression analysis without revealing their private data to each other.
##  RUN:
1. `make` to compile the code
2. first run party1 `.\party1` to run the party1.
3. then run party0 `.\party0` to run the party0.
4. `make clean` to clean the compiled file
