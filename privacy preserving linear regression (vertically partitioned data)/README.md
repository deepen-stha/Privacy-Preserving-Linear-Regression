# Multiple Linear Regression with privacy
This implements the linear regression where the data is `vertically partitioned`. Specifically, it enables two parties (Alice and Bob) to jointly perform regression analysis without revealing their private data to each other.
##  RUN:
1. `make` to compile the code.
3. `.\privacy_preserving_multiple_linear_regression` to run the code without privacy preserving. 
4. `make clean` to clean the compiled file
